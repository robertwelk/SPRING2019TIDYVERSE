```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# 1.Create an Example.Using one or more TidyVerse packages, and any dataset from fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle, create a programming sample “vignette” that demonstrates how to use one or more of the capabilities of the selected TidyVerse package with your selected dataset.

## Load the library
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Data source
https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

## Read the data using readr

```{r}
disease <- read_csv("heart.csv")
head(disease)
```


The selected package I want to use id dplyr.

## Capability 1.

### filter capability tutorial

### Description

Using filter we can select rows of the data frame matching conditions.

### Usage
filter(data)
### Example

To select the people of over 20 and less than 65 we can pass the data disease and condtion age>20 and age < 65 to the function . It'll return matching rows of heart disease.

```{r}
filter(disease, age>20 & age < 65)
```

## Capability 2.

### select capability tutorial

###Description

Using select we can keep the selected variables

###sage
select(data, ...)

###Example

To keep only age, sex,cp variable we can pass the data disease and age, sex,cp to the function . 

```{r}
df<- select(disease, c("age","sex","cp"))
head(df)
```

## edit - rob welk
Using select() in dplyr as well as ggplot() we can create a scatter plot of cholesterol levels as a function of age highlighting differences in men and women.
```{r}
disease %>% 
  select(age, sex, chol) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age,y=chol,color=as.factor(sex))) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab('Age') + 
    ylab('Cholesterol') + 
    labs('Sex')
```
